#Mockup Generator

The Problem?
When you create a design and decide to sell it in different apparel. There is lot of data entry and lot of image creation. Both of these work is not what make designing fun.

The Solution
This software does all the data entry work and automates photoshop to create mockup.

Requirement
1. It requires Python 3.7 or newer to run.
2. It requires Photoshop CC.

Limitation
I developed this software for my portfolio. Please keep in mind -
1. Software doesn't have any error check feature. It will simply crash if data feeded is wrong (feeding string on int fields etc.)
2. It contains mock-ups for front print only. Though I have given choice for selecting the print position, I haven't created mock-ups for other positions (back, left pocket, right pocket) or implemented the code. It is something I have planned for future.
3. Amature Coding. Yes, this is my first project. If you're going through code, sorry for this. Feel free to ping me if you need to understand what I was thinking (mostly nothing).
